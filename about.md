I'm [Andrew Yao](http://www.linkedin.com/in/yaoandrew). I live in Santa Monica, CA with my wife, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. I work as a software engineer at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com). In the past, I've mostly worked in the finance industry at investment banks, quantitative research firms, and trading software companies.

## What is this blog for?

I do this for selfish reasons. Storage is cheap and I need a way to keep track of things I'm interested in.
