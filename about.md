I'm [Andrew Yao](http://www.linkedin.com/in/yaoandrew). I live in Santa Monica, CA with my wife, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. I am currently a resident apprentice at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com). Most of my career has been in electronic or algorithmic trading of equities, derivatives, or currencies at investment banks, trading software firms, startups, or in quantitative research.

## What is this blog for?

I need a way to keep track of things I'm interested in, organize my thoughts on research topics, and document things I am trying to learn and explore. I hope that other people might find at least some of these topics helpful or interesting.
