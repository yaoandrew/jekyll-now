There are a number of great tips in the book 97 Things... Each one reads like a short story that illustrates a point and discusses the value proposition of that point. Now remembering all 97 things might be difficult, but it might make sense to think about a few a each point in your project/career lifecycle. This post will attempt to create a short cheatsheet of which 'things' to consider at each point in your project.

### Planning your project
- Automate your coding standard - have a style and stick to it as a team. Automatically check this. 
- Take advantage of code analysis tools - use static analysis tools to help debug and enforce your coding standard.
- Code layout matters - consider reasons for choosing one layout over another. Should it be easy to scan? Expressive to read?
- Plan to have regularly scheduled code reviews - make them fun, have experts and newbies participate, share knowledge, learn from the code.
- Choose your tools with care - use third party libraries to support your development but make sure you understand the lifecycle, frequency of updates, legal, and licencing issues that come along with them.

### Starting a project
- Beauty is in simplicity
- Code is design
- Don't repeat yourself
- Golden Rule of API design
- Make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Encapsulate behavior, not just state

### Making your build
- Deploy early and often
- Keep the build clean
- Let your porject speak for itself
- Own (and refactor) the build
- One Binary
- Don't touch that code

### IPM time
- Your customers do not mean what they say
- Read the humanities
- Ask, "What Would The User Do?", (You are not the user)
- Start from Yes

### Chugging through stories
- Act with prudence - pay off technical debt along the way, don't let it accrue.
- Boy Scout Rule
- Prevent errors
- Distinguish business exceptions from technical
- Verbose logging will disturb your sleep
- Don't rely on "Magic Happens Here"
- Test while you sleep (and on weekends)
- Write code as if you had to support it for the rest of your life

### Career enhancements
- Do lots of deliberate practice
- Continuous Learning
- Don't just learn the language, learn its culture
- Read code
- Reinvent the wheel often
- Fulfill your ambitions with open source
- Hard work does not payoff
- Know your IDE
- Know how to use command line tools
- The professional programmer
