It is a new year and similar to the feeling I get on birthdays, when we flip the calendar to January, I start to feel really anxious about what I'm going accomplish in the year ahead. It had been a while since we had an IPM. Between the holidays, the flu, and my being a little behind on some refactoring I was working on, it felt like too long had passed. This week, I really wanted to close out two tickets that were nearly done and keep moving the ball forward. I found the nearest openings in my clients' schedules and jammed an IPM in between the only whitespace across our three respective calendars. It didn't feel right, it felt rushed, but I thought I could demo my features, discuss the new tickets, and get cranking on some new functionality. Needless to say, it didn't go exactly as planned, because there wasn't an actual plan.

After the meeting where my clients had watched the following happen live- my code not compile, my tests not pass, and said features not being demo'd, I decided to consult with a fellow apprentice on his approach.

>"An IPM is a performance" - Ian Carroll

As soon as he said it, something clicked. Much has been said of hiring developers with diverse cultural, ethnic, and academic/non-traditional backgrounds. Ian began explaining his approach by incorporating his own experience in theater and performance art. "An IPM is a performance...", said with the type of color and emphasis only a person from the theater could bring. Ian went on to describe how he treated IPMs like a performance of which he tirelessly prepared and rehearsed for. Watching him connect his prior background to the task at hand instantly reminded me of two things - his similarity to Cary Elwes in the Princess Bride and that my own background should have informed me better.

As a buyer of 8th Light's software, the IPM is the one time a week I can see how my money is being spent. It's an opportunity to see if I've properly allocated my capital expenditures and product development time. As I'm cutting checks where inevitably anything more that $0.00 feels expensive, you can be sure that I'll be looking for any signs of weakness. I'll be trying to poke holes in the strategy or the approach. I'll be looking for signs of vaporware and sifting through the smoke and mirrors. In my prior career, I spent a lot of time doing demos of the trading technology we were selling. We would have to convince clients to press a button which would send hundreds of millions of dollars worth of orders flowing through our technology. You can imagine the career risk associated with that action. As such, you can imagine the amount of skepticism and focus we were met with on our demos. Our clients typically look like this at work:

Prior to our meetings, my team and I would try to anticipate who would be in the meeting, their personas, their pain points, fears, uncertainties, and doubts. We would want to have a proper response and quantitative data to back up and address every one of those potential issues. If we were going to a client's office, we'd want to make sure the room was appropriately sized, the video display was working and we had the proper connective cabling. We'd make sure we had a network connection and bring a 4G wifi hotspot as backup. We would research what holdings they had in their portfolios, their trading strategy, and seed our demo with appropriate data and bring a transaction analysis report for their given country, currency, and sector of investments.

In short, we'd go into these meetings hoping we had anticipated anything they could throw at us and that we had prepared the right quantitative analysis knowing that everything was going to be viewed from the perspective of someone bearing a tremendous amount of career risk in making a decision to use us as a counterparty to their trades. As Ian so eloquently concluded, an IPM is a performance. Just like the demos of our technology in my previous job were a performance. They were a performance to win over your confidence that we weren't going to get you fired or cause a massive market disruption. We basically have to make a strong case that [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-02/knight-shows-how-to-lose-440-million-in-30-minutes) won't happen. We have to make a strong case that even after that happened [this](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100976404) doesn't happen shortly after.

Looking through this lens, I certainly would have second thoughts about jamming in an IPM that I wasn't really prepared for. Had I rehearsed my demo? Had I made sure everything was working? Had I preloaded everything I was going to demo? Made a slide with the agenda for the day so I could control the meeting? Had I setup the room a few minutes prior to the meeting start time and made sure the projector was available and working? Had I anticipated additional questions my client might ask and prepared content to back up answers to those questions? I probably could have predicted the outcome based on how prepared I felt. I didn't feel good, I wasn't ready, and I hadn't properly prepared and rehearsed my performance. I picked up two important things from Ian - remembering your prior experience has relevance for the current role and "An IPM is a performance..."
