It is a new year and similar to the feeling I get on birthdays, when we flip the calendar to January, I start to feel really anxious about what I'm going accomplish in the year ahead. It had been a while since we had an IPM between the holidays, the flu, and my being a little behind on some refactoring I was working on. This week, I really wanted to close out two tickets that were nearly done and keep moving the ball forward. I found the nearest openings in my clients' schedules and jammed an IPM in between the only whitespace across our three respective calendars. It didn't feel right, it felt rushed, but I thought I could demo my features, discuss the new tickets, and get cranking on some new functionality. Needless to say, it didn't go exactly as planned, because there wasn't an actual plan.

After the meeting where my clients could watch the following happen live- my code not compile, my tests not pass, and said features not being demo'd, I decided to consult with a fellow apprentice on his approach.

>"An IPM is a performance" - Ian Carroll

As soon as he said it, something clicked. Much has been said of hiring developers with diverse cultural, ethnic, and academic/non-traditional backgrounds. Ian began explaining his approach by incorporating his own experience in theater and performance art. "An IPM is a performance...", said with the type of color and emphasis only a person from the theater could bring. Ian went on to describe how he treated IPMs like a performance of which he tirelessly prepared and rehearsed for. Watching him connect his prior background to the task at hand instantly reminded me of two things - his similarity to Cary Elwes in the Princess Bride and that my own background should have informed me better.

An IPM is a performance. As a buyer of 8th Light's software, the IPM is the one time a week I can see how my money is being spent. Its an opportunity to see if I've properly allocated my capital expenditures and product development time. As I'm cutting checks where inevitably anything more that $0.00 feels expensive, you can be sure that I'll be looking for any signs of weakness. I'll be trying to poke holes in the strategy or the approach. I'll be looking for signs of vaporware and sifting through the smoke and mirrors.
