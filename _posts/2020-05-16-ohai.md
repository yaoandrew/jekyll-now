### Oh üí©
There's nothing more sad than looking at your blog and realizing you haven't written anything in years. The second most sad thing is realizing you said you'd commit to writing more in 2020 only to find that it's already mid-May ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I won't dwell too much on my failure here. I'll just say, rather publicly, that I'm going to write more and that I'll spend less time worrying about how it looks and whether something should be a post on (insert social platform), tweet, tumblr (if that's still a thing), or a blog entry ‚úçÔ∏è. For simplicity sake, I'll concentrate on being more consistent on the blog. Technical writing and note taking will probably still be in the form of a [gist](https://gist.github.com/yaoandrew/345fc726d6117b7175f518a31bad70e7).
### Motivation
Why start writing now? Well, honestly, if I don't, it will never happen and recently I've had a few things I thought I'd be interested in writing about. As we enter into our 3rd month of staying home, I've been catching up with some old colleagues that I seem to have neglected longer than my blog. A common question that naturally comes up after a long period of no contact is

<p align="center">". . . what the #*@& have you been up to ?"</p>

and I don't have a great answer for it. I find myself sort of dodging the question and sounding WAY too [Californian](https://youtu.be/Tt-tG6ufH90?t=100) with my answer of "you know, some work, a bunch of surfing, hiking, and coaching soccer." üå¥üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•æ Mostly because the answer is, or at least I thought, kind of complex and too deep of a rabbit hole to dive into over Zoom. I've started to realize that most of this is a failure of communication on my part and I should be able to articulate what I'm doing in appropriate levels of technical detail. Writing some thoughts down is a perfect way to get organized with a coherent answer without worrying about droning on and on üí§. 

**NOTE:** This guide is to help me explain to my Mom that I didn't spend a career catering to drug dealers first at a Swiss Bank and now in crypto. It is not going to dive into technicals about how we parse event logs from the chain or expose MakerDAO data via a graphQL API.

### Decentralized Finance
I work in a space called decentralized finance (DeFi, if we must have a short, catchy nickname). The not so modest goal of DeFi is often stated as creating a brand new monetary system on top of public blockchains üßê. If you think about our existing monetary system and some of its components, someone is trying to create a version of this in DeFi. Within the industry there are varied [applications](https://pixelplex.io/blog/top-12-ethereum-defi-lending-dex-payment/) that focus on lending, exchanges, derivatives, prediction markets, and no loss games. As someone who comes from a traditional finance background, I came into the space as a real curmudgeon.

I think about the regulatory moat that banks have surrounding their businesses coupled with a healthy dose of skepticism about the utility of blockchains. That combination is having me execute some real mental gymnastics to have an open mind about DeFi applications.

The concept of decentralization is best perhaps explained in the context of bitcoin. Without getting into some long existential discussion, we still need to do a little setup so let's consider some properties money has. Money is a store of value and a medium of exchange üí∏. When we hand someone a $20 bill, that is money we stored (saved) being transferred (exchanged) to someone else. In the modern day, we are handling cash like this less frequently - Apple Pay, Venmo, Paypal, Zelle, and before that wire transfers and ACH payments allow us to move money without physically counting out bills.

Let's break down how this works. You tell your bank to pay party A, your bank confirms you actually have the money there, then pays party A. The same happens when you use a payment app like Venmo. You type in the Venmo app a cute little message with emojis üçïüçªüéâ to pay your friend. Venmo makes sure you have the money, then sends it over to your friend. The theme here is that a `centralized` entity (the bank or Venmo) is required to determine that you have the money to send. These financial intermediaries confirm balances, help settle disputes, and reverse fraudulent transactions. They can also be control points for law enforcement and government agencies. What would be required to do this without a middle man?
